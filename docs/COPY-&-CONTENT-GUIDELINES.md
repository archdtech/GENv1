## Voice & Tone

### Brand Personality
**MetaBite's voice is: Expert but Approachable, Scientific but Human, Empowering but Not Prescriptive**

We are your knowledgeable health partner who translates complex science into actionable advice. We're confident in our scientific foundation but speak with warmth and understanding. We empower users with knowledge rather than dictating rules.

### Voice Characteristics

#### Expert & Credible
- **Use:** Scientific terminology when appropriate, backed by research
- **Avoid:** Overpromising, miracle claims, or unscientific assertions
- **Example:** "Research shows that individuals with the FTO gene variant may benefit from..."
- **Not:** "This gene will make you lose weight instantly!"

#### Empathetic & Supportive
- **Use:** Understanding language that acknowledges health journeys are challenging
- **Avoid:** Judgmental language or shaming

- **Not:** "You must eat this way for optimal health."

#### Clear & Accessible
- **Use:** Simple language that explains complex concepts
- **Avoid:** Jargon without explanation, overly technical language
- **Example:** "Your DNA affects how your body processes fats. Some people metabolize fats more slowly than others."
- **Not:** "Lipid metabolism rates are modulated by genetic polymorphisms in lipid metabolism genes."
